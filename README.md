## Description

Participants will engage in collaborative activities aimed at enhancing their understanding of the Teal framework.
The workshop will be structured based on valuable feedback gathered from leaders during cross-industry discussions in forums such as the PHUSE Working Groups.

With increasing interest from regulatory agencies in promoting data transparency and accessibility, this workshop will provide a platform to showcase practical applications of the Teal framework while ensuring alignment with regulatory expectations.
Our presentation at the PHUSE CSS in May highlights the relevance of this topic in ongoing industry conversations.

We welcome participants from various industry backgrounds to join us at the PHUSE EU Connect for this engaging workshop.
Attendees will be guided through both beginner and advanced examples of creating interactive visualisations using Teal.
They will learn how to build a Teal app with integrated modules and develop customised modules to address more complex scenarios.

Moreover, the workshop will review the Teal roadmap and discuss the prioritisation of future features.
If time allows, we will host a mini-hackathon, where attendees can actively contribute to Teal’s development by enhancing documentation or adding new modules to existing Teal packages.

This interactive experience promises to foster learning and collaboration while advancing skills in data visualisation.
