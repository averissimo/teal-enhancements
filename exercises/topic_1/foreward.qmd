## What is `teal`?

`teal` is a powerful **R framework** designed to streamline the development of **interactive data analysis applications**.
Built on top of Shiny, `teal` provides a modular, standardized approach to creating sophisticated data exploration and visualization tools.

## `teal` ecosystem
`teal` is just one R package from a `teal` ecosystem. Other packages that we will be using
during these workshops that come from `teal` are:
* `teal.modules.clinical`
* `teal.modules.general`

There are multiple other packages that are developed alongside `teal`. You can find
a comprehensive list at http://github.com/insightsengineering.

## Key characteristics of `teal`

- **Modular Architecture**: Build applications using reusable, interchangeable components
- **Reproducible Analytics**: Maintain complete analysis reproducibility with built-in code tracking
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design accessible to both developers and end-users
- **Clinical Focus**: Specialized modules for pharmaceutical and clinical trial data analysis
- **Interactive Exploration**: Real-time data filtering, visualization, and analysis capabilities

## How `teal` fits with `shiny`

`teal` is built **on top of Shiny**, extending Shiny's capabilities specifically for data analysis applications:

- **Modular framework**: While Shiny provides the reactive infrastructure, `teal` adds a standardized, modular architecture for data analysis modules
- **Reproducibility layer**: `teal` adds automatic code tracking and reproducibility features that go beyond standard Shiny applications
- **Clinical data handling**: `teal` provides specialized data structures and workflows for clinical trial data (CDISC/ADaM) that aren't available in base Shiny
- **Integrated filtering**: `teal` includes a sophisticated filter panel system that works seamlessly across all modules, which would require significant custom development in pure Shiny

In essence, `teal` takes Shiny's reactive web application framework and adds the specialized tools, patterns, and infrastructure needed for reproducible, clinical-grade data analysis applications.
