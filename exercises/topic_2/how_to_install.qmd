##  How to install the `teal` framework? 

You should have all the packages already preinstalled during these workshops on
the remote workbenches we have prepared. 

When you are starting from scratch (or just reinstalled your R version):
```{R}
install.packages(c(
    "teal", 
    "teal.modules.clinical", 
    "teal.modules.general", 
    "teal.osprey", 
    "pharmaverseadam"
))
```
