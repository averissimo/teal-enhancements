##  How to install the `teal` framework?

You should have all the packages already preinstalled during these workshops on
the remote workbenches we have prepared.

When you are starting from scratch (or just reinstalled your R version):
```{.r}
install.packages(c(
    "teal",
    "teal.modules.clinical",
    "teal.modules.general",
    "pharmaverseadam"
))
```
