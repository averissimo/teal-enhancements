# Training materials

## Foreword

The main topic covered is developing applications using `teal` framework:

- what is `teal`
- launching `teal` applications
- understanding data in `teal`
- understanding how to launch modules from `teal.modules.general`
  and `teal.modules.clinical`
- understanding the tools given to users by `teal`:
  - filter panel
  - report functionality
  - saving filter state to files
  - bookmarking
- creating custom `teal` modules

## Prerequisites:

- basic proficiency in R programming language
- basic proficiency in Shiny

## Sources of knowledge

- `teal` documentation: https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal, https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/
- `teal.modules.clinical` documentation: https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.modules.clinical
- `teal.modules.general` documentation: https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.modules.general
- `teal.reporter` documentation: https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.reporter

## Principles of this training

- every behaviour description is accompanied with a code sample (preferably from `shinylive`, so the trainee can explore on their own)
- complex topics (`teal` behaviours) are presented not only in text, but also visually using a graph or a plot
